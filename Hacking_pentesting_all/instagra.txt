what is dns bindng

DNS binding, also known as DNS rebinding, is a type of attack that exploits the way web browsers handle domain name resolution. In this attack, an attacker is able to bypass the same-origin policy of a web browser by manipulating the DNS resolution of a domain name.

The attack works by tricking a victim's web browser into resolving a domain name to an IP address that the attacker controls. The attacker can then use this to execute malicious code within the context of a victim's browser, potentially allowing them to steal sensitive information or take control of the victim's computer.

The attack typically involves a multi-stage process, where the attacker first sends a malicious website or email to the victim that loads a script. The script then establishes a connection with a server under the attacker's control, which responds with a different IP address than the original domain name. This allows the attacker to establish a connection between the victim's browser and the attacker's server, allowing them to execute malicious code.

To protect against DNS binding attacks, it's important to use secure coding practices, ensure that all input is properly validated, and to use security measures such as Content Security Policy (CSP)
