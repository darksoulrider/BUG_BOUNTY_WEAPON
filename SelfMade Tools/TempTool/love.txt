Task A Use your favorite language ( c++ ) to demonstrate the BEFORE and AFTER of memoization, when multiplying two larger numbers, say 5000 and 3800 . Set up the problem similar to the class demonstration: 

def square(n): 
    result = 0
    for p in range (n) : 
        for q in range (n) : 
            result +=1
    return result 

print(square(5))
